                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Graduated from Aston university in 2017 with a degree in chemical engineering. Went onto to set up my own business after studies. I have had years of experience tutoring students chemistry and maths. I wanted to set up an online website , where this can be more accessible to more students. In order to do so, I started learning the html language. The more I knew about it and what it could do, I got more and more keen. This made me realise that how bad I wanted a career path in technology. Sparta  global has provided me with the platform which will help me with the transition of my career.</p>
                <p>I love playing football and have been playing for a local club for a year. I also learnt to play piano and self taught myself to play drums.

                    <p>This was the first project that was given during the second week of the sparta global training. Four pages was made completely only with the html language. one homepage where all the available was shown. Used downloaded thumbnail from Google to make a thumbnail for the videos and linked to the video page. Three pages which had the videos embedded using the iframe from YouTube page itself which also had the controls for the video. YouTube logo on the top of the page was also linked to be redirected to home pages on all pages. </p>

                    <img src="Images/INSTAGRAM.png" alt="Image not found">
                  <p>This was the second project that was given in the second week of sparta global training. This project involved replicating the entire homepage of the official instagram sign up page only using the html and CSS. Used html language to create the layout of the page and then used CSS to determine the position of the texts, images and other components.
                  The logo and images used was downloaded from the official website itself, inorder to replicate to most precise form.

                    <p>This was the third project that was given in the second week of sparta global training. The webpage was made with the help of bootstrap 3, which made a lot easier to position the components in the required place. The webpage font family was obtained from the Google fonts. The webpage also made use of lot of the inbuilt components of the bootstrap. For example, the inbuilt nab bar was used and the web page has the black theme nav bar. JavaScript and jQuery was used to create a dropdown menu when viewed on a small screen. Inbuilt panels from bootstrap was also used in the technical section.</p>
